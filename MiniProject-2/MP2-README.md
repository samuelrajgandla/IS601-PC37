You'll be implementing a basic Business Management site. There will be some provided files fully working as-is and some skeleton files you'll need to fill in. The files you need to fill in will have TODO items or comments mentioning what's expected. There are provided test case files too that all must be passing for full credit. Do not edit these test case files. The site will handle CRUD operations for Companies and Employees as well as allowing import of Company/Employee data via a csv file.

Baseline files: https://github.com/MattToegel/IS601/tree/F22-MiniProject-2 May want to download branch as a zip, then copy/paste the files into your repo

Provided files you don't need to edit:

000_create_table_companies.sql
001_create_table_employees.sql
db.py
init_db.py
flash.html
company_dropdown.html
country_state_selector.html
upload.html
sort_filter.html
all test files
geography.py
__init__.py (remains empty)
Dockerfile
main.py
index.py
All other files likely have requirements to fill in.
